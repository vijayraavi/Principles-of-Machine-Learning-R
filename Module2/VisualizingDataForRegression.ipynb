    "# Lab 4: Visualizing Data for Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn how to use Python to **visualize and explore data**. This process is also known as **exploratory data analysis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization. First to understand the relationships between the data columns. Second to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified. Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill.\n",
    "In this lab you will explore two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this lab, your first goal is to explore a dataset that includes information about automobile pricing. In other labs you will use what you learn hrough visulaization to create a solution that predicts the price of an automobile based on its characteristics. This type of predictive modeling, in which you attempt to predict a real numeric value, is known as **regression**; and it will be discussed in more detail later in the course. For now, the focus of this lab is on visually exploring the data to determine which features may be useful in predicting automobile prices."

    "  * What columns are of interest?\n",
    "  * What are the characteristics of the data derived from summary statistics and counts?\n",
    "- **Developing multiple views of complex data** using multiple chart types. Exploring complex data requires multiple views to understand the many relationships. It is impossible to develop a complete understanding from just a few plots.\n",
    "- **Overview of Matplotlib, Pandas plotting and Seaborn** which are commonly used Python plotting packages. \n",
    "- **Overview of univariate plot types** is a reveiw of creating these basic plots using three Python packages. These plot types allow you to study the distributional properties of the variables in your data set. \n",
    "- **Overview of two dimensional plot types** is a reveiw of creating basic plot types used to construct visualizations. These plots naturally display the relationship between two variables on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Using Aesthetics** is an overview of how to project additional plot dimensions using plot aesthetics. Using aesthetics provides a method for projecting additional dimensions onto the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
    "- **Facetted plotting** also know as conditioned plotting or lattice plotting, introduces a powerful method for visualizing higher dimensional data. Arrays of plots of subsets of the data are arranged on the 2-d computer graphics display. \n",
